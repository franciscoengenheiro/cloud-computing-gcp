The project is divided into multiple Maven~\cite{maven} modules, each with a specific purpose:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{cloud-http-function-ip-lookup}: Contains the cloud function implementation for the IP lookup service;
    \item \textbf{grpc-client}:
    Contains the gRPC client implementation of both the functional and scaling contracts, as well as the main client application;
    \item \textbf{grpc-server}: Contains the gRPC server implementation of both the functional and scaling contracts;
    \item \textbf{grpc-functional-contract}: Contains the RPC functional contract definition;
    \item \textbf{grpc-scaling-contract}: Contains the RPC scaling contract definition;
    \item \textbf{labels-app}: Contains the application that processes the image files, translates the labels, and stores the results in Firestore;
    \item \textbf{logging-app}: Similar to \texttt{labels-app} module, but without any image processing logic.
\end{itemize}
